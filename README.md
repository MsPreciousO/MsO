introduction to git
Hola, this is Precious One... I am working now on learning how to work with the webpages.. This is a Women studies program-course. 
My instructors are Charles and Willy.. The class has been going along slowly now to accommodate those of us who are not so familliar with computers. I am finding this fairly interesting and a bit stressful... stressful because I do not want to miss anything and get behind.. 
At the end of this I am hoping to be able to be more comfortable and computer aware...
